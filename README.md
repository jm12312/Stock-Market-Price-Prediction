# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction


This repository contains code and Jupyter Notebooks for predicting stock market prices using machine learning techniques. The aim of this project is to explore, visualize, and model stock price data to make informed predictions about future prices.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing for stock market datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms for price prediction
- Performance evaluation and comparison of models
- Interactive Jupyter Notebooks for reproducible research

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: All code and analysis are presented in interactive notebooks.
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical analysis.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **Other Libraries**: Additional libraries as required (e.g., yfinance for fetching stock data, TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models).
